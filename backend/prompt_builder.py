prompt_builder.py
------------------
All prompt-engineering lives here. chatbot_engine.py decides WHAT the
user wants (intent); this file decides HOW to phrase that request to
Nova (the model).

build_messages() (general/casual intent) still takes raw `history` and
extends the messages list with it - single-turn drift wasn't observed
on the general path, so it's left as-is.

build_counseling_prompt() no longer does this - see its own docstring
and chatbot_engine.summarize_history() for why: nova-counseling-v2
loses coherence when handed several raw prior turns, so counseling
replies now get a one-line topic SUMMARY embedded in the system
prompt instead, and the LLM only ever sees the current message as an
actual conversational turn.
